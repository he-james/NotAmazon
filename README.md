# NotAmazon
## By Beff Jezos

Final project for S308, requirements were to create a book-rental system. It's not the best work I've ever done but was excellent experiential learning as far as an introduction to C#, .NET, and WPF goes. 

A rushed project, had 2 months but due to course layout, team was only fully on the same page about a week prior to the deadline (System.IO, StreamWriter/StreamReader were critical to development but taught far too late)

## What I learned
* Development of WPF applications in C#
* Expanded knowledge of OOP
* Design of basic data stores using C# System.IO

## Technologies
- Visual Studio
- C# WPF
