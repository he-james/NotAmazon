Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success by Adam Grant|1|ATTENTION: THIS BOOK IS NOT THE GIVER I had to READ THE GIVER for my 7th Grade english CLASS and then I askd my Mom To buy this book for me but It's actually NOT THE GIVER.

The Giver by Lois Lowry|2|I finally got the book! I read that other book though and it changed my life, now that I understand the symbiotic exchange between peoples on an everyday basis, I actually moved up from my position as a 7th grader to a 17th grader. I am the only 12 year old in my graduate school program at Harvard Business School. Will update, like and subscribe.
